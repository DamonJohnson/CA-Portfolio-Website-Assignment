## **Description**

### Purpose
The portfolio website has been created to present myself as a student developer to IT professionals and prospective employers.
The porfolio demonstrates my ability in creating a simple website and will be updated with projects and blog articles as they are completed. By providing information about my background and personality it assists employers in matching me to their organisation.

### Functionality / Features
The site structure consists of 4 main pages and an additional 5 blog pages.

**The Home Page:** The homepage Contains a hero banner video that creates an aesthetically pleasing landing page without distracting from the minimal text displayed on the page. Within the hero banner is a simple animated list of skills as developr. Below the hero banner are card previews of the blog articles designed to draw readers in.
