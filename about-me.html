            Hi, I'm Damon, a web development student based in Brisbane, Australia.
            After working for two years as a geotechnical engineer I've enrolled in Coder Academy's full-stack web development bootcamp where I'm learning the skills required to build websites and web applications across multiple frameworks.
            <br>
            In my time at uni I studied civil engineering where I was first exposed to coding in matlab and python. 
            When working with GIS in my research thesis I began to see the efficiencies that could be found by applying python scripts to repetitive tasks. From here, I started to learn some basic coding and not long after was gearing up for a full career change. In February 2022 I left my fulltime job to enrol with Coder Academy with the aim of developing a broad software development skillset and gaining employment in industry upon completion of the course.
            This portfolio website will document my progress towards this goal.
