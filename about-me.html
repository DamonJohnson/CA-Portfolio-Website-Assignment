            Hi, I'm Damon, a junior web developer based in Brisbane, Australia.
            <br></br>
            I am currently studying the final term of Coder Academy's Coding Bootcamp to attain a Diploma of Information Technology and kick start a career in software development. 
            I'm also a graduate of Queensland University of Technology where I completed a Bachelor of Civil Engineering with minors in Environmental Management and Construction.
            <br></br>
            Before I started my coding journey I worked as a geotechnical engineer where I was able to get my hands dirty, hone my problem solving skills and learn to work and communicate with all kinds of people.
            During this work I felt limited by the technology that was available to me and started to experiment with some coding to see if I could optimise the regular and monotonous processes involved with the job.
            Before I knew it, I was bitten by the coding bug and decided to enrol in Coder Academy's accelerated bootcamp.
            <br></br>
            I've really enjoyed the journey of learning to code and I'm excited to use these skills in a software development role.
            Please get in touch if you'd like to discuss any work opportunities or if you'd like to find out more about any of my projects.
            Thanks for visiting!
