                    The project was a GIS based site suitability assessment for solar and wind farms to facilitate green hydrogen production and export within Australia.
                    The project applied geospatial information systems (GIS) methods of analysis and mapping techniques to perform a regional scale suitability assessment of potential solar and windfarm sites within regions of Australia that have been identified for their high potential for green hydrogen production.

                    In order to complete the project, a set of spatial datasets were compiled and processed to build a geodatabase.
                    Geoprocessing methods based on python methods were applied to the geospatial data to form raster layers that stored the suitability weighting data for land parcels.
                    The end result was a series of maps displaying the areas considered most suitable for solar and wind farm development.
